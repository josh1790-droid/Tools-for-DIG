00:00:06.357 --> 00:00:10.357
Hello, everybody. My name is Joshua, and…

00:00:11.212 --> 00:00:16.212
This is the video for my digital research project.

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.110
So, for my project, I decided to explore

00:00:22.237 --> 00:00:24.237
the topic of…

00:00:24.408 --> 00:00:26.408
social media…

00:00:26.865 --> 00:00:28.865
versus the student.

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:31.449
Especially when it comes to the mental health.

00:00:32.301 --> 00:00:35.301
And how is… how social media is affecting our students.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.640
academic performance and overall lives.

00:00:39.886 --> 00:00:41.886
So, I wanted to…

00:00:43.037 --> 00:00:48.037
I wanted to see what I could use to present this information. Of course, when we were presented

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.150
Uh, the assignment…

00:00:51.006 --> 00:00:54.006
And we're giving… excuse me, we're given

00:00:54.006 --> 00:00:56.103
Uh, multiple ways to present this.

00:00:56.248 --> 00:00:59.248
I'm not… I wasn't sure which tool I was gonna use.

00:00:59.515 --> 00:01:02.515
And I ultimately decided with Twine,

00:01:03.743 --> 00:01:05.743
Simply because for that particular…

00:01:06.864 --> 00:01:13.864
assignment, I believe I spent probably the most time on that one. It was extremely challenging.

00:01:13.863 --> 00:01:17.177
Assignment for me, I was like, well, if it didn't challenge me, then it'll challenge me now.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.180
And I want to be able to…

00:01:20.388 --> 00:01:23.388
do storytelling in a way that I have never…

00:01:23.395 --> 00:01:25.395
ever tried before, so…

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.280
Um, this was… I decided to use Twinery as my digital tool to present.

00:01:31.552 --> 00:01:33.552
my research project, and…

00:01:33.543 --> 00:01:39.543
Um… I wanted to be able to kind of give a narrative and go down different scenarios.

00:01:39.945 --> 00:01:43.945
Um, so… just kind of dig into it a little bit.

00:01:44.247 --> 00:01:51.247
Um, here's my, of course, my tools for digital humanities main page.

00:01:52.093 --> 00:01:56.093
But we'll get to that a little bit later. I'm going to show you, get into the GitHub.

00:01:56.092 --> 00:01:57.778
And kind of where we were.

00:01:57.778 --> 00:02:00.368
Um, as well as our…

00:02:00.816 --> 00:02:02.816
twinery.

00:02:02.816 --> 00:02:09.642
So we go in here… I won't really bore you with all of the code and tracery, but I will let you…

00:02:10.074 --> 00:02:12.074
Let's see where we were.

00:02:13.288 --> 00:02:15.288
As far as the pathways that we created,

00:02:15.451 --> 00:02:17.451
To get to our… oh…

00:02:17.756 --> 00:02:19.756
my final product.

00:02:19.756 --> 00:02:24.246
So, within Twinery, um, we created

00:02:24.313 --> 00:02:27.313
pathways and stories, um…

00:02:27.546 --> 00:02:31.546
to show not only the negative side of

00:02:31.903 --> 00:02:33.903
too much social media consumption.

00:02:35.127 --> 00:02:38.127
But also, I wanted to showcase or highlight

00:02:38.073 --> 00:02:41.073
Um, different solutions that…

00:02:41.814 --> 00:02:45.814
myself, students, whoever the viewer and or reader is,

00:02:46.305 --> 00:02:51.305
Uh, can use to break those bad habits and become successful as a student.

00:02:52.364 --> 00:02:54.364
Uh, and just as a person in general.

00:02:56.053 --> 00:03:00.053
Um, and then we started off here at the top, and then we go into our choices.

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:05.409
Uh, and then from there, you can see that I went into 4 different categories.

00:03:05.906 --> 00:03:10.906
academic decline, mental health decline, social isolation,

00:03:11.843 --> 00:03:15.843
and physical consequences, with each having their own pathways and scenarios.

00:03:17.155 --> 00:03:20.155
Um, that the player or the viewer could go through.

00:03:20.155 --> 00:03:22.795
And… and see different scenarios.

00:03:22.843 --> 00:03:24.843
And come to differing conclusions.

00:03:26.236 --> 00:03:29.236
So, I did all of this, and I won't bore you with

00:03:29.735 --> 00:03:31.735
all of the details, um…

00:03:33.324 --> 00:03:37.324
like I said, I did want to… I did want to showcase some of those, uh…

00:03:38.604 --> 00:03:41.604
creative outlets and find different ways that we can

00:03:42.603 --> 00:03:45.603
Overcome. So, I went ahead and programmed it,

00:03:46.036 --> 00:03:51.036
put in those… those pathways, uh, and I try to make it as short as possible.

00:03:51.187 --> 00:03:53.187
the reader to…

00:03:53.941 --> 00:03:55.941
get too bored with it.

00:03:57.252 --> 00:04:01.252
And, uh, so I try to streamline it as much as possible.

00:04:01.197 --> 00:04:04.197
But it… all of it revolved around…

00:04:04.382 --> 00:04:06.382
Um…

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.470
the topic, which…

00:04:09.057 --> 00:04:12.057
I think is one of the most, uh, pressing

00:04:12.304 --> 00:04:14.304
Um…

00:04:15.954 --> 00:04:21.954
issues that we have, uh, as students. And I say that as we, because it's something that I deal with as well.

00:04:22.342 --> 00:04:27.342
Not saying that I conquered it totally, but I believe I've been able to create some habits that…

00:04:27.623 --> 00:04:29.623
I'm able to utilize to…

00:04:30.841 --> 00:04:34.841
provide, or to create better…

00:04:35.653 --> 00:04:37.653
academic performance. So let's go back into…

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:43.100
our GitHub, I went ahead and went into the research project, uh…

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.120
File, and…

00:04:47.491 --> 00:04:51.491
I'm like… unlike our professor, I…

00:04:51.457 --> 00:04:53.457
took a…

00:04:54.324 --> 00:04:57.324
I took a liking to HTML a little bit more than MD or Markdown.

00:04:58.887 --> 00:05:00.887
And I was able to embed it here,

00:05:01.081 --> 00:05:04.081
Uh… into the GitHub page.

00:05:04.433 --> 00:05:06.433
went ahead and provided my sources.

00:05:08.016 --> 00:05:11.016
A side note, while I was doing the research,

00:05:11.014 --> 00:05:13.139
there was plenty…

00:05:13.676 --> 00:05:15.676
of literature.

00:05:15.677 --> 00:05:18.674
on this topic, way more than I thought so.

00:05:18.674 --> 00:05:21.164
And using strictly…

00:05:21.359 --> 00:05:23.359
the UCF Library.

00:05:24.701 --> 00:05:29.701
I was able to, um, browse through and research and find what I needed.

00:05:29.798 --> 00:05:31.798
Um, through the library.

00:05:32.062 --> 00:05:34.062
And was able to…

00:05:34.831 --> 00:05:36.831
find different things.

00:05:37.742 --> 00:05:40.742
That solidified the solutions that I was able to provide. So we got that there.

00:05:42.142 --> 00:05:46.142
And… alright, let's go back to my main page, project list.

00:05:49.491 --> 00:05:51.491
research project…

00:05:53.998 --> 00:05:57.998
And then here we are, my final research project. This was a big project, and it took many hours to create.

00:05:57.998 --> 00:06:02.435
But I'm happy to present a tag of the phones a twine tail.

00:06:02.695 --> 00:06:04.695
Um, so here we go.

00:06:06.162 --> 00:06:08.162
A twine tail, let's see, does it pull up?

00:06:11.786 --> 00:06:13.786
Yes, it does. Okay.

00:06:14.829 --> 00:06:20.829
So, just a quick read. The world we live in revolves around connections through social media platforms.

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:26.759
For college students, this connection often comes at a cost. Overexposure to social media has been linked to depression,

00:06:28.033 --> 00:06:30.033
Anxiety, poor study habits,

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:36.260
and sedentary lifestyles. This interactive story explores the consequences of social media overconsumption,

00:06:36.908 --> 00:06:39.908
And the possible pathways towards healthier outcomes.

00:06:40.279 --> 00:06:45.279
Where will your choices lead? And then, of course, we go ahead and click…

00:06:45.188 --> 00:06:50.188
Here, and automatically we got 4 different pathways that we can choose from.

00:06:51.293 --> 00:06:59.293
Um… and I usually, at this point, let the viewer go ahead and go through it, so let me just click through…

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:04.840
Let's see, the safe physical consequences… I'm a big…

00:07:05.379 --> 00:07:07.379
workout, physical activity type of guy.

00:07:08.584 --> 00:07:15.584
Hours of fitting with your phone leads to headaches, eye strain, and fatigue, physical inactivity becomes the norm, and your body begins to rebel.

00:07:16.365 --> 00:07:22.365
sedentary lifestyle worsens, you're maybe creating a feedback loop of exhaustion, irritability, or excuse me, irritability.

00:07:24.624 --> 00:07:29.624
Exercise, lifestyle changes, social activities… let's try exercise and lifestyle changes.

00:07:30.457 --> 00:07:37.457
And then, of course, more pathways. Like I said, I love exercise, I love working out. Let's go ahead and use that one again.

00:07:38.555 --> 00:07:46.555
you commit to daily, excuse me, short daily workouts, a jog, or even dance in your room, movement lifts your mood, reduces stress, and sharpens your focus.

00:07:47.317 --> 00:07:51.317
Your body feels stronger, and your mind follows continue building healthier habits.

00:07:51.334 --> 00:07:53.334
By embracing healthy habits,

00:07:53.573 --> 00:07:58.573
Sleep, exercise, nutrition, and mindfulness, you reclaim control of your well-being. So this is your…

00:07:58.833 --> 00:08:02.833
And, uh, goal, or I guess, say, your success.

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:06.920
A conclusion? Um, by following a healthier…

00:08:07.503 --> 00:08:11.503
habit or lifestyle, which I said earlier would be a solution.

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:14.680
to what I would consider

00:08:14.877 --> 00:08:16.877
a negative issue.

00:08:17.358 --> 00:08:20.358
Uh, with us students. And then, of course, you go back to the home.

00:08:20.564 --> 00:08:24.564
page, or your starting point, I guess is the best way I could say that.

00:08:25.561 --> 00:08:30.561
You can go from there, and you can explore as the reader different pathways, go into the negative sides of things.

00:08:31.237 --> 00:08:33.237
Actually, let's go ahead and try that. Um…

00:08:35.515 --> 00:08:37.515
mental health decline, because that was the main thing.

00:08:38.035 --> 00:08:41.035
I was attempting to tackle.

00:08:42.601 --> 00:08:44.601
To use scrolling despite the pain.

00:08:45.345 --> 00:08:48.345
And then I went ahead and made this pretty short, because…

00:08:49.162 --> 00:08:53.162
I don't… you can go down a longer pathway, but…

00:08:53.161 --> 00:08:54.769
at the end of it all, I believe

00:08:54.822 --> 00:08:57.822
This was a great summary, um…

00:08:57.807 --> 00:08:59.807
to show…

00:09:01.588 --> 00:09:04.588
The end result of the overconsumption.

00:09:04.964 --> 00:09:07.964
of social media. And then, of course, return to the start, and here we are.

00:09:08.905 --> 00:09:10.905
So…

00:09:12.552 --> 00:09:16.552
I'm not sure if you can see the other side of the screen. I have my abstract.

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:21.630
Their proposal when we first were introduced to the assignment, and of course, my annotated…

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:27.860
bibliography, um, that I was able to go through, which, like I said, was an extremely tedious

00:09:28.733 --> 00:09:30.733
tedious, uh…

00:09:31.916 --> 00:09:33.916
procedure or progression.

00:09:34.143 --> 00:09:36.143
to find everything that I needed.

00:09:36.897 --> 00:09:40.897
Um, and so, that there is.

00:09:42.195 --> 00:09:44.195
my digital…

00:09:45.707 --> 00:09:48.707
research project. Let's see if I can go back to…

00:09:50.121 --> 00:09:52.121
My main page, there we go.

00:09:53.019 --> 00:09:58.019
So, I hope you enjoyed, and feel free to go ahead and check out the Twined, and…

00:09:58.034 --> 00:10:00.034
Go down those pathways.

00:10:00.886 --> 00:10:03.886
I do appreciate your time, and have a great evening.
