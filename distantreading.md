Here is a few themes that werw found when searched CoPilot: The main themes of Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea by Jules Verne, based on the full content of your document, span across science, philosophy, adventure, and social commentary. Here's a structured breakdown of the key themes:

1. Scientific Exploration and Discovery
The novel is a celebration of marine biology, oceanography, and technological innovation.
Through the eyes of Professor Aronnax, readers explore the mysteries of the deep sea, including coral reefs, marine life, shipwrecks, and even the lost continent of Atlantis.
The Nautilus itself is a marvel of engineering, powered by electricity and equipped with advanced instruments for underwater navigation and research.
2. The Power and Limits of Technology
Verne juxtaposes the imaginative power of fiction with real-world scientific progress.
The Nautilus represents both the triumph and the danger of unchecked technological advancement.
The submarine’s capabilities—speed, stealth, weaponry—are awe-inspiring but also isolating and destructive.
3. Isolation and Freedom
Captain Nemo chooses to live beneath the sea, rejecting terrestrial society and its injustices.
His submarine becomes a symbol of personal freedom, but also of emotional and ideological isolation.
The tension between freedom and captivity is central to the experience of Aronnax, Conseil, and Ned Land.
