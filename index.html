<h1>Welcome to Josue's Corner</h1>


<p>Here is my little corner of the Web. I am a writer, published author and sometime, dance instructor; as well as a few other talents and interest. As of now, I have no prior history of coding or website building. I will be using this tool to aid me in builing those skills. I currently hold employment with the U.S. Air Force Reserves as a full time Reserve Technician. There I use my maintenance technology knowledge to inspect and repair aircraft as needed. However, my interest lies in the creative arts. Thats why my small corner will consist of ideas and compiled work that will aid me in becoming a better writer and overall creative. Hopefully, in time, these ideas and imaginations will bear fruit on a screen somewhere in the world. I wish to touch and affect lives with through my writing and eventaully, see my writ come to life in film. Enjoy!
