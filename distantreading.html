# Distant Reading Assignment 

*These are my findings useing Voyant and CoPilot respectively. I chose to the novel of 20,000 Leagues Under the Seas by Jules Verne.*

Here is the a an image of the Cirrus and Trends created by Voyant when I submitted the title of the novel:  <img width="1696" height="936" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/22261d01-c9f4-4174-8077-5f18beea9649" /> <img width="2548" height="1700" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3d1b431a-b914-4c32-9779-889c11a6fc02" />



Here is the summary statement that was given when I used CoPilot for the novel: The main themes of Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea by Jules Verne, based on the full content of your document, span across science, philosophy, adventure, and social commentary.

Now when I asked CoPilot the questions posed in the assignment, here is what I received: 

So, what do these results actually tell me about the book?

Copilot: They give you a solid understanding of the main themes. You learn that the story is about:

Scientific exploration and discovery
The power and danger of technology
Captain Nemo’s isolation and philosophy
The beauty and mystery of the ocean
Revenge, justice, and moral complexity
Companionship and conflict among the crew
Social and political commentary

That’s a lot. Do I also get a sense of the story?

Copilot: Yes! You see the journey of the Nautilus, the characters involved, and the major events—like the discovery of Atlantis, battles with sea creatures, and Nemo’s final act of vengeance. You also get historical and scientific context, like the real-life expedition of La Perouse and the use of electric propulsion.

❓ What You Can’t Know
What’s missing from these results?

Good question. You don’t get:

The exact language or literary style of Jules Verne
The emotional depth or psychological nuance of the characters
Symbolism or deeper allegorical meanings
The immersive experience of reading the novel yourself

So I can’t really “feel” the story?

Copilot: Exactly. You get the structure and ideas, but not the atmosphere, suspense, or poetic detail that Verne uses to bring the ocean to life.

✅ Are These Results Accurate?
Can I trust this summary?

Copilot: Absolutely. It’s based directly on the full text you uploaded. The themes and events are drawn from the actual chapters, including the foreword, character introductions, and final scenes. It’s a reliable overview.

What I discovered about using these two tools is the uses for both are different. While Voyant is great for imperical date, Copilot is more usefeul when attempting to see whats relative to the reader. It can be used for imperical data but the format is more user freindly. It is more converational or personal in its approach. If I need to find more accurate trends or ponder data-mapping then Voyant would be more useful there. However, if I want to read the history of the topic then CoPilot would be ypur safest bet.
