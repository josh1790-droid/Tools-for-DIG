  <h1> Abstract </h1>
  <p></p> This project looks at how music consumption has changed from physical formats to digital streaming and how these shifts affect culture and personal experiences. Using a storyboard format, it follows key milestones — vinyl, cassettes, CDs, MP3s, and streaming platforms like Spotify — to show how access, personalization, and sharing have transformed listening habits. By combining history with user perspectives, the project shows music as both a technology and a universal human experience. It also reveals how new ways of distributing and designing music shape the industry and how people form identity, community, and meaning through sound.<p></p>
