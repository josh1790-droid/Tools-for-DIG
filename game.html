  <h1> Abstract </h1>
  <p></p> Here I explored Twine and Bitsy to see their constraints and how I could use my creativity in a manner I hadn't before. Twine is text-focused and flexible: you build branching narratives with links between passages. It allows custom CSS, JavaScript, and variables, so you can design very complex interactive fiction — but it requires more setup and coding if you want advanced features.

Bitsy is intentionally minimalist: it uses an 8×8 pixel art grid and very limited color palettes. Storytelling happens through small rooms, sprites, and short dialogue snippets. It has almost no coding, making it easy for beginners but also limiting in complexity and multimedia options.

In short: Twine offers greater narrative and technical freedom but expects more learning; Bitsy offers tight creative constraints that encourage simplicity, visual charm, and micro-storytelling.<p></p>
